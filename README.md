### Character synchronization

In order to make the addon remember your characters, you need to group them manually one single time per character.
Once the character is groupped, the addon will automatically remember it and all the others characters that belongs to you in the same group.

Warning, if you change the server of one of your character by buying the Blizzard server tranfer, you'll need to re-synchronize it.

### Character list

The characters list and their connected/disconnected status does not yet updates automatically. You will need to refresh it by clicking the corresponding icon on the top-right corner of the addon interface.

All your characters displays as a list, with a button allowing you to group them easily. The connected characters are displayed first so it's easier to find them. You can group all your connected characters with one click on the corresponding button.
